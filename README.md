# Randomness Test of π's Digits

## Overview
The "Randomness Test of π's Digits" project is designed to statistically evaluate the randomness of the digits of π (pi). Utilizing several statistical tests, this project aims to determine whether the digits of π are independently and uniformly distributed, which is crucial for applications in fields like cryptography and numerical simulations.

## Purpose
This project seeks to apply and validate statistical methods to assess the hypothesis that the digits of π are random. Such analysis is critical for understanding theoretical aspects of mathematical constants and enhancing our methods in statistical testing.

## Features
- **Tallest Middle Triplets Test**: Evaluates the frequency of triplets where the middle digit is the largest.
- **Z-Score Calculation**: Employs the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to compute the Z-score of the observed counts from the triplets test.
- **Permutation Test**: Simulates the distribution of the tallest middle triplets under the assumption of randomness to validate the observed results.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/randomness-test-pi.git
